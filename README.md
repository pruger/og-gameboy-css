GameBoy CSS: ***Retro GameBoy-style*** CSS framework


# About
GameBoy CSS is a minimalist CSS framework that captures the classic GameBoy aesthetic with its iconic green monochrome display, pixelated borders, and retro styling. It is designed to be simple, small, and easy to use.

### Features
* Tiny CSS framework with GameBoy aesthetic
* Authentic retro styling
* Simple and lightweight

### Font Requirement
This framework uses the Early GameBoy font created by Jimmy Campbell as the primary font, with Press Start 2P as a fallback. You have two options:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Use the primary font
1. Download Early GameBoy from [Dafont](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font)
2. Install it on your machine, or
3. Host it on your server and link it properly

**Option 2 (Fallback):** The framework includes Press Start 2P as a fallback font, which will load automatically from Google Fonts if Early GameBoy is not available.

**Credit:** Early GameBoy font by [Jimmy Campbell](https://www.dafont.com/jimmy-campbell.d5241) | Press Start 2P by [CodeMan38](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P)

### Installation
Local installation:
```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="gameboy.css">
```

### Usage
GameBoy CSS provides components with predefined GameBoy-style appearance. You will need to define your own layout. The framework will automatically use Early GameBoy font if available, or fall back to Press Start 2P.
